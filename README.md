# go-anim

go-anim is a utility for generating images or animations using a simple scripting language.

It uses my [go-script](https://github.com/peter-mount/go-script) to provide the underlying language,
and can be extended by other projects or run on it's own.

My [piweather.center](https://github.com/peter-mount/piweather.center) Weather Station project
uses this to generate still and timelapse video's with telemetry overlaid.

Like those two projects, documentation still needs to be done.
